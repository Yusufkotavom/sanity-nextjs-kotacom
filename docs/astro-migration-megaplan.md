  - [x] new design system applied to key templates
  - [ ] mobile + desktop verified for header/nav/CTA/content pages

## Current Status Snapshot (Already Done)

- [x] **GSC MIGRATION 100% DONE:** All Top 300 manual curations + Top 1000 auto-redirects fully synced, seeded, and mapped via Sanity and Next.js wildcards.
- [x] Template rewrite architecture upgraded to lane-aware conversion shells: `pageTemplate` now carries explicit `lane`, `trustMode`, and source-of-truth policy; structured copy supports rule-based content variants; and rewrite pages render one clear variant-driven narrative instead of stacking duplicate hero/pricing/proof layers.
- [x] All 4 live `pageTemplate` documents have now been patched to the new conversion model in Sanity, including lane-specific pricing/proof/testimonial content, capped quick CTAs, and city-aware support-copy variants for location routes.
- [x] Obsolete one-off template patch scripts have been removed from `frontend/scripts`, leaving a single maintained upgrade path for live template conversion content and reducing accidental rollback risk.
- [x] Template-backed location override documents now also have a normalization path for legacy field-shape drift, and the known `jasa-cetak-buku-surabaya` override has been brought in line with the active testimonial contract.
- [x] Template-backed `pageLocation` and `serviceLocation` documents have been brought out of legacy `draft/noindex` state, so active money pages and location-route descendants now align with the public indexing intent of the new rewrite architecture.
- [x] Template resolver guardrails now have direct frontend contract coverage for token stripping, lane filtering, trust-mode copy selection, source-policy precedence, and route-kind inference.
- [x] SEO Ops automation hardening completed: manual indexing now uses real queue jobs, GSC daily pull now aggregates page/query/country/device, and GA4 imports are persisted in DB for dashboard joins.
- [x] SEO Opportunity Board added in operations dashboard with quick wins (high impressions + low CTR), decay detection, and indexing blocker monitoring.
- [x] Seo-dashboard Netlify build hardening completed: Sanity/env-sensitive API imports are now lazy-loaded to prevent `Failed to collect page data` crashes during production build.
- [x] Frontend instrumentation pass completed for GA4 + WhatsApp conversion tracking: root GA loader, route page_view dispatch, and shared WA click events now wired across floating/header/rewrite/SEO block CTA surfaces.
- [x] Default GA4 measurement ID now set to `G-P0DQM5CH0D` with env override support (`NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID`) to simplify deployment activation.
- [x] Netlify prerender blocker resolved for GA4 instrumentation: root tracker no longer uses `useSearchParams`, preventing suspense-boundary errors on `/_not-found` and dynamic slug pages.
- [x] Netlify edge bundling blocker mitigated by removing unused frontend `proxy.ts`, preventing generation of `___netlify-edge-handler-node-middleware` artifact that crashed plugin bundling on Next.js 16.1.7.
- [x] SEO dashboard operations UX now includes functional manual `Run Audit` input form (URL batch enqueue), and internal worker cron now supports `pull-ga4` for GA4-to-DB daily sync automation.
- [x] Frontend manual trigger bridge now available for internal worker jobs (`/api/seo/ops/trigger` + dashboard Analytics trigger panel), so ops can run GA4/GSC/audit pipelines on-demand in addition to scheduled cron.
- [x] Ops env contract now includes explicit GA4/GSC vars required by automated tasks (`GA4_PROPERTY_ID`, optional GA4 creds, `GSC_SITEMAP_URL`) to reduce runtime misconfiguration risk.
- [x] Real env sync completed for GA4/GSC/Sitemap across root + frontend + seo-dashboard + studio examples (`G-P0DQM5CH0D`, `https://www.kotacom.id`, `https://www.kotacom.id/sitemap.xml`, stream/property value `2168616948`) to keep tracking and import flows aligned.
- [x] Added root-level unified env template (`.env.all-in-one.example`) as a single source of config truth for frontend, studio, and seo-dashboard setup.
- [x] Netlify frontend deploy env has been trimmed via `netlify.toml` overrides to prevent AWS Lambda 4KB environment overflow during function upload.
- [x] SEO dashboard Vercel build typing break fixed for GA4 cron import path (`googleapis` runReport request contract updated), and local `seo-dashboard` build is green again.
- [x] Netlify runtime module-resolution hardening applied at root workspace (`next/react/react-dom` root dependencies) to address `Cannot find module 'next/dist/server/lib/start-server.js'` crash after deploy.
- [x] Added Netlify function bundling guard (`external_node_modules` for `next/react/react-dom`) to ensure Next runtime packages are present in deployed server function bundle.
- [x] Netlify Next.js adapter is now explicitly pinned in workspace dependencies (`@netlify/plugin-nextjs@5.13.3`) to avoid runtime drift with platform default plugin versions.
- [x] Netlify config now uses auto-detected Next.js runtime path by removing explicit `[[plugins]]` adapter block from `netlify.toml` for compatibility testing.
- [x] Netlify function packaging now includes explicit fallback includes for `___netlify-server-handler` (`next/react/react-dom`) to reduce runtime module resolution failures.
- [x] Migration closeout doc cleanup completed: obsolete migration-only docs removed from `docs/` to keep active documentation focused on operational workflows.
- [x] Post-migration documentation prune wave 2 completed: stale SEO dashboard phase summaries removed and dead doc references in legacy README/script paths replaced with active/archive links.
- [x] Removed the 8-item validation cap from navigation submenus in the Sanity schema (`link.ts`), permitting expanded menu structures.
- [x] Standardized `surface-panel` global CSS utility to enforce a unified transparent glassmorphism background across all components (Hero, CTA, Grid Cards, Split Panels).
- [x] Fixed `cta-1` block layout: buttons are now fully encapsulated by the section panel background and are properly centered alongside the text content.
- [x] GSC export + migration curation pipeline built

- [x] Ops dashboard MVP scaffolding shipped: shared packages (db/ai/search/seo/content/sanity), worker cron scheduler, ops API endpoints, and shadcn/Geist UI for Jobs/Templates/AI/SEO/Search/Analytics.
- [x] Critical import behavior confirmed: dotted document IDs (example `post.import.*`, `page.legacy.*`) are visible in authenticated reads but can be missing in public published reads used by frontend build/runtime
- [x] Shared `legacy-rich-content` block contract added for Markdown/HTML raw rendering and wired to both `page.blocks` and `post.body` (`block-content`)
- [x] Sanity import smoke test completed with safe ID strategy (no dots): 2 pages + 2 posts published and visible in both public and authenticated published reads
- [x] Legacy content renderer finetuned with parser/sanitizer pipeline plus `legacy-prose` styles so HTML/Markdown lists, numbering, tables, and headings render consistently
- [x] Dedicated hybrid preview route `/home-pepar` now exists as a homepage-preparation surface, so the next live home iteration can be tested with real Sanity top/bottom zones before replacing `/`
- [x] `/home-pepar` now carries a fuller homepage-candidate middle section aligned to the live `kotacom.id` information architecture, giving the migration a realistic rehearsal surface instead of a scaffold placeholder
- [x] `/home-pepar` has now been polished into a more realistic live-candidate flow: one CMS hero above the shell, a less repetitive code-owned middle section, and CMS proof/CTA blocks below with preview-safe metadata
- [x] Next.js dev tooling warnings reduced by setting explicit Turbopack root and migrating `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`
- [x] Netlify proxy runtime compatibility fix applied: `frontend/proxy.ts` now pins runtime to `edge` to avoid node-middleware edge bundling crash on Next.js 16 builds.

- [x] Astro header navigation snapshot normalized and imported into the live Sanity `navigation` document, including grouped submenu migration, legacy-route sanitization, and GSC-informed/live-page submenu curation
- [x] Navigation contract now supports footer-only top-level links via Studio-controlled `showInHeader` + `showInFooter` flags, and header rendering respects that split
- [x] Header navigation interaction tightened: submenu descriptions removed for cleaner information density and mobile accordion now opens in fully collapsed state by default
- [x] Header IA split from broad “Services” bucket into specific top-level entries (`Home`, `Web Dev`, `IT Service`, `Percetakan`, `Portfolio`, `Produk`, `About`, `Contact`) with `Blog` retained as footer-only support link

- [x] Agent communication policy now enforces Sanity dev-first credential usage (`SANITY_DEV` -> `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN`) and env documentation/examples are aligned for safer CMS automation
- [x] Redirect rollout hardening added: build-time Next.js redirect loader now supports authenticated Sanity fetch for private `redirect` documents, plus diagnostics to expose redirect count/token mode in deployment logs
- [x] Root homepage `/` no longer relies on a full-Sanity body render; it now uses the shared hybrid shell with Sanity-managed top/bottom block zones around a code-owned middle section, while `/home` and `/product-home` remain redirect aliases to `/`
- [x] Sanity block schema defaults now include `_key` values for object-array `initialValue` payloads, preventing Studio `Missing keys` editor errors on seeded CTA/hero/grid/split/timeline blocks
- [x] Sanity agent-toolkit skills have been vendored into the repository under `skills/` so CMS/content-modeling guidance is versioned alongside the codebase
- [x] Claude SEO has been vendored locally under `skills/claude-seo`, so repo-level SEO audits and planning can use pinned local skills, agents, scripts, references, and docs instead of machine-global installs
- [x] `hero-2` now supports soft binding to `page.title`: when the block title is empty, frontend resolves the displayed heading from the parent page document instead of requiring duplicated CMS content
- [x] `hero-1` and `section-header` now follow the same soft binding pattern to `page.title`, so three core heading blocks can inherit the page title without duplicating CMS fields
- [x] Header and mobile navigation now expose a dedicated WhatsApp CTA sourced from global `settings.whatsApp`, while the existing `navigation.headerCta` remains available as a separate action from the navigation document
- [x] Post, product, service, project, rewrite, legacy, and JSON-usaha CTA surfaces now aggressively prioritize the global WhatsApp CTA contract, and a dedicated `whatsapp-cta` Sanity block is available for CMS-driven placement
- [x] Sanity Studio theme color overrides now use visual swatch pickers in `settings.themeColors`, so editors can choose brand colors without relying on raw HEX knowledge
- [x] Sanity Studio `Theme Colors` now also includes an embedded usage guide, preset preview cards, and recommended combinations so non-technical editors can understand the visual impact before editing tokens
- [x] Theme configuration is now isolated in a dedicated singleton `Theme Settings` document instead of the general `Settings` document, reducing editor confusion while preserving the same `themeColors` contract for frontend consumption
- [x] Rewrite hero CTA now uses explicit WhatsApp branding when the primary CTA resolves to WhatsApp, and the hero visual background has been consolidated so the image panel no longer carries a separate large gradient layer
- [x] Rewrite hero image frame has been reduced to a single background treatment, removing the remaining layered glow panel so the visual block reads cleaner and lighter
- [x] The `/pembuatan-website` cluster copy has been cleaned of internal editorial/process language and refocused on public-facing lead, trust, inquiry, and sales messaging across the core page, city template, company profile, toko online, and shared landing defaults
- [x] The `/pembuatan-website` specialist descendants (`harga`, `migrasi-wordpress`, `dokter-klinik`, `expedisi`, `sekolah`, `konstruksi`, `komunitas-ngo`, `template`) now also carry richer page-specific keyword, FAQ, process, and CTA copy instead of relying on thinner generic website-page defaults
- [x] The same public-copy cleanup has now been extended into the `software` and `percetakan` rewrite clusters, removing internal/editorial language from shared generators, specialist overrides, and money-page presets while strengthening customer-facing value and CTA messaging
- [x] The core `percetakan` money pages (`/percetakan`, `cetak-buku`, `cetak-company-profile`, `cetak-brosur`) now carry sharper print-intent keyword sets, more specific process/FAQ guidance, and CTA copy aligned to actual print decisions such as POD vs offset, material choice, and campaign distribution
- [x] A repo-wide public-content sweep has now cleaned additional internal/editorial wording from homepage local-content and shared rewrite generators, leaving internal-only surfaces such as `component-ui`, `test-page-hybrid`, and SEO dashboard pages as the primary remaining matches in local scans
- [x] Rewrite landing sections have been compacted from long stacked split scenes into denser lane/grid compositions, and `/component-ui` now documents the updated, less fragmented section pattern
- [x] Rewrite landing sections have been split into focused modules under `components/ui/rewrite/landing-sections/*`, keeping the public component entry stable while making the section system easier to maintain
- [x] Legacy rewrite content architecture split into modular registry-based content sources (`content/core`, `website`, `printing`, `software`, `misc`, `registry`) so route discovery, shared SEO enrichment, and per-cluster copy no longer depend on a single monolithic generator file
- [x] Priority slug override source also split by cluster (`website-overrides`, `printing-overrides`, `software-overrides`) so page-specific tuning is no longer stored in one mixed override map
- [x] Percetakan anchor pages (`/percetakan`, `/percetakan/cetak-buku`, `/percetakan/cetak-brosur`, `/percetakan/cetak-company-profile`) now resolve through dedicated page modules under `content/printing-pages/*` instead of living only as branches inside the cluster builder
- [x] Remaining `percetakan` detail presets and `cetak-buku` city-intent overrides are now stored in dedicated `printing-pages/*` modules, leaving `printing.ts` as a smaller resolver/fallback orchestrator
- [x] Software anchor pages (`/software`, `/software/pembuatan-software`, `/software/implementasi-software`, `/software/instalasi-software`, `/sistem-pos`) now resolve through dedicated `content/software-pages/*` modules, with `software.ts` reduced to shared fallback logic and overrides partially moved into page-focused modules
- [x] `pembuatan-website` anchor pages (`/pembuatan-website`, `/pembuatan-website/harga`, `/pembuatan-website/jasa-pembuatan-website-company-profile`, `/pembuatan-website/jasa-pembuatan-website-toko-online`) now resolve through dedicated `content/website-pages/*` modules, with website-specific overrides starting to move out of the mixed cluster file
- [x] Remaining non-city `pembuatan-website` service routes (`jasa-migrasi-wordpress`, `dokter-klinik`, `expedisi`, `komunitas-ngo`, `konstruksi`, `sekolah`, `template`) now also use dedicated `content/website-pages/*` modules, leaving city routes as the primary parametric fallback path
- [x] Slow parity pass started for `pembuatan-website` page modules by comparing Astro source against Next page-content modules; `company-profile` and `toko-online` now carry more of their original enterprise/e-commerce intent instead of generic website-copy fallback
- [x] Hybrid delivery pattern is now demonstrated end-to-end on `/test-page-hybrid`: code-driven route shell plus Sanity `page` blocks (`hero`, proof via `grid-row`, `cta`, `faqs`) seeded through dev-first credentials for concrete evaluation before applying the model to money pages
- [x] Sanity page-array guardrails are now scripted: page audits detect missing `_key` and missing `link.isExternal`, while a normalizer can patch legacy `page` documents in place to keep Studio editing safe
- [x] Hybrid demo public-read issue resolved: `/test-page-hybrid` now uses public-safe hyphenated document IDs for the `page` and referenced `faq` docs, and the FAQ renderer skips null dereference results instead of crashing if a referenced document is unavailable
- [x] Repo-level execution guidance now codifies public Sanity guardrails in `AGENTS.md` and a reusable `skills/sanity-public-content-guardrails` skill, so future agent-driven seed/import work follows the same public-read-safe rules by default
- [x] `/test-page-hybrid` now uses a clearer blueprint layout: code-owned intro/source diagnostics, separated Sanity hero/proof and conversion zones, explicit ownership mapping, and a fallback-oriented explanation section that is closer to the intended money-page hybrid pattern
- [x] Hybrid demo now supports page-level split control via `topBlockCount`, allowing editors to keep one freeform `blocks[]` array while choosing how many blocks render before the code-owned middle section
- [x] `/pembuatan-website` main route now has a real hybrid wrapper: top and bottom Sanity `page` blocks are split by `topBlockCount` around the existing rewrite shell, and a seeded public `page` document provides an initial support/proof + CTA layer without replacing the live local funnel logic
- [x] The main-route hybrid pattern is now reusable: `pembuatan-website`, `percetakan`, and `software` use a shared `PageHybridShell`, seeded public `page` documents exist for all three slugs, and repo guidance includes a dedicated hybrid-content workflow skill
- [x] The shared hybrid shell now also covers `/` and `/layanan`: homepage keeps a code-owned positioning layer between Sanity zones, and `layanan` now follows the same editable top/bottom block contract around its legacy rewrite shell
- [x] Sanity Studio now surfaces a lightweight list-level indicator for hybrid `page` documents (`Hybrid · Top N`), so editors can identify hybrid main pages and their current split without opening each record
- [x] Hybrid rollout now has a preset-based CLI scaffold (`hybrid:create`) that can dry-run or write public-safe `page` documents with verified `topBlockCount` and seed blocks, reducing friction when converting additional main routes to the shared hybrid contract
- [x] Hybrid rollout now has a dedicated operational doc (`docs/hybrid-page-cli-workflow.md`), so page conversion no longer depends on reading source scripts or skill files to understand modes, presets, and safety rules
- [x] Hybrid rollout now also has an anti-duplicate route bootstrap generator (`hybrid:route:create`) that can scaffold repo files plus Sanity seed flow in one dry-run-first workflow for newly hybridized main pages
- [x] Hybrid rollout no longer depends on CLI alone: Sanity Studio now exposes an `Apply Hybrid Preset` action on eligible hybrid `page` documents, allowing editors to seed or refresh draft hybrid blocks without terminal access
- [x] Hybrid rollout terminology and operational coverage are now sharper: the workflow uses the clearer `supported hybrid slug` concept, and smoke tests have validated unsupported-slug rejection, dry-run behavior, bootstrap writes, duplicate protection, and cleanup
- [x] Root-page blog backlog now has a dedicated `page -> post` conversion CLI with documented dry-run/write workflow, allowing temporary `page` articles to be copied into the `post` schema and `/blog/[slug]` routes without destructive type changes
- [x] Root-page blog backlog no longer depends on CLI only: Sanity Studio now exposes a draft-safe `Convert Page to Post` action so editors can bootstrap post documents from page documents directly inside Studio
- [x] Rewrite is now more clearly the active visual reference: unused pre-rewrite duplicate shells have been archived, and the core Sanity block components used by generic pages have been restyled toward the rewrite section/panel language
- [x] Universal trust badge strip now uses icon-led glass cards instead of text-in-image artwork, bringing the shared rewrite shell closer to the current shadcn/Vercel visual direction and removing duplicated badge wording
- [x] Universal trust badge cards have been compacted further so icon + title sit on one line and the supporting copy stays ultra-short, improving density without falling back to image-based labels
- [x] `project` documents now include `categories` again in the Studio schema and frontend query contract, resolving Sanity `Unknown field found` warnings on legacy project docs that still store category references
- [x] Printing products catalog is now populated in Sanity CMS using 10 custom generated high-quality visuals, ensuring proper product coverage and visual continuity on `/products` routes
- [x] Global PageSpeed pass applied: Sanity CDN defaulted for production, homepage data queries capped and cached, main layout revalidation set to 10 minutes, icon imports tree-shaken, and portable-text images compressed for faster LCP.
- [x] Block rendering now code-split via dynamic imports and detail-page Sanity fetches cache with 10-minute revalidation for faster TTFB/LCP on all content templates.
- [x] Detail-page hero LCP tuned: product/service/project hero images now use CDN width hints, quality 85, and priority + sizes; rewrite/post icons are tree-shaken.
- [x] CWV batch tuning pass: Sanity image default quality set to 75, grid/card imagery constrained to width hints, detail hero images now include LQIP blur, and grid image preloads reduced to the first item to limit LCP contention.
- [x] Build fix: Lucide icon imports reverted to package entry points to avoid ESM subpath resolution failures on Vercel.
- [x] Consolidated `/layanan` into `/services` with richer service catalog content and removed the `/layanan` routes (sitemap/TOC/internal links updated).
## Workstream A - Platform & Data Foundation

### A1. CMS Contract Freeze
- [ ] Finalize document contracts for `post`, `service`, `product`, `project`, `category`, `seoSettings`, `redirect`.
- [ ] Remove/disable unused Supabase dependencies in migration path.
- [ ] Confirm frontend query contracts mirror studio schema exactly.
- [x] Navigation link contract synced: `link`/`navigation-link-child` destination validation + `category` reference support aligned with frontend query mapping.
- [x] `project` document contract shipped across Studio schema, frontend GROQ/fetch layer, and route rendering.
- [x] Env/deploy contract synced for AI Writer + SEO Ops required keys across `frontend/.env.example`, `studio/.env.example`, and deploy env templates.
- [x] SEO Ops dashboard moved to standalone app package to decouple operations tooling from the main frontend runtime.
- [x] Ops dashboard MVP groundwork complete (shared packages, worker cron scheduler, core ops API + UI screens).
- Blocker note (2026-04-02): Full A1 closure still pending audit for remaining document contracts (`project`, `redirect`) outside Worker 2 navigation scope.

### A2. Route Contract Freeze
- [x] Publish canonical target route map:
  - `/blog/[slug]`
  - `/blog/category/[slug]`
  - `/services/[slug]`
  - `/products/[slug]`
  - `/projects/[slug]`
- [x] Mark exceptions for legacy pages to keep as dedicated landing pages.
  - Done in rewrite orchestration contract for non-blog static clusters (`about`, `contact`, `privacy`, `layanan`, `pembuatan-website`, `percetakan`, `software`, `sistem-pos`).
- [x] Identify routes to be redirected only.

### A3. Import Pipeline
- [x] Define extractor from Astro source content (MDX/frontmatter/static data) to import payload.
- [x] Import high-priority content first (GSC weighted).
- [x] Validate slug uniqueness and canonical mapping.
  - Added import safety note: avoid dotted `_id` patterns for page/post imports to ensure visibility in unauthenticated published API reads.
  - 2026-04-02 execution: imported missing repo-Astro MDX documents only, leaving local fallback pack `frontend/content/astro-local/jasa-cetak-buku-kota` untouched.
- [x] Repo-local Astro source pack (`frontend/content/astro-local/jasa-cetak-buku-kota`) now has a reusable importer that creates missing Sanity `page` docs and preserves slug/canonical parity for root-slug routes.

## Workstream B - Per-URL Curation (One by One)

### B1. Manual Queue Execution (Top 300)
- [x] Process `gsc-manual-priority-top300.csv` line-by-line.
- Note: v3 one-by-one curation completed for top-300 with explicit final decision per URL; 32 items remain `keep_or_redirect` pending CMS content existence validation.
- Progress snapshot (2026-04-01):
  - `approved_redirect`: 268
  - `approved_keep_or_redirect`: 32
  - `pending_manual_intent`: 0
  - Output files: `docs/curation/manual-top300-worklist-v3.csv`, `docs/curation/manual-top300-approved-redirect-v3.csv`, `docs/curation/manual-top300-keep-or-redirect-review.csv`, `docs/curation/manual-top300-pending-manual-intent-v3.csv`
- [x] For each URL, assign:
  - keep (migrate as page)
  - redirect (301 target)
- [x] Add explicit reason code per mapping decision.

### B2. Auto Queue QA (Top 1000)
- [x] Validate `gsc-redirect-auto-top1000.csv` for false positives.
- [x] Spot check by intent similarity (topic, keyword, business intent).
- [x] Approve for wave-based deployment.

### B3. Long-tail Backlog
- [x] Continue remaining manual queue (750 total manual candidates).
- [x] Archive low-value URLs (noindex/410 strategy candidate list).
  - 2026-04-02 execution: finalized `28` spam/judi + blog-template root URLs as explicit `410 Gone` candidates and enforced them in frontend `proxy` to prevent redirect dilution and soft-404 behavior.

## Workstream C - SEO Rewrite & Optimization

### C1. Metadata Rewrite Program
- [x] Rewrite title/meta for high-impression URLs with quality guardrails.
- [ ] Enforce length policy:
  - title target 50-60 chars
  - [x] meta description target 120-155 chars
- [ ] Ensure canonical consistency for paginated and variant pages.
- [x] Legacy rewrite copy hardening completed for service/trust clusters to reduce boilerplate and improve intent-specific keyword coverage.
- [x] Legacy rewrite templates now accept Sanity override documents to control hero/highlights/FAQ/section order/custom blocks with build-only fetch.
- [x] Centralized SEO enrichment pass added to rewrite content pipeline (keyword dedupe/expansion, FAQ intent coverage, and long-guide fallback generation for main clusters).
- [x] Slug-intent SEO pass added (pricing/migration/cetak-buku/ecommerce/implementasi intent signals) with reusable enrichment rules in rewrite content engine.
- [x] Manual money-page rewrite v2 shipped for 16 high-intent slugs (`pembuatan-website`, `harga`, `jasa-migrasi-wordpress`, `jasa-pembuatan-website-*` selected pages, `template`, `percetakan` selected pages, `software`, `pembuatan-software`, `implementasi-software`, `instalasi-software`, `sistem-pos`) with conversion-focused headline/intro/CTA/FAQ tuning.
- [x] Manual city rewrite v1 shipped for top 20 `jasa-cetak-buku-<kota>` routes (based on local GSC priority file) through centralized city override map in rewrite content engine.
- [x] Money-page SEO length pass confirmed on frontend source layer (14 money routes + top 20 city routes; title 30-60 and description 120-155 after normalization, `TOTAL_FAIL=0`).
- [x] Manual money-page rewrite v4 completed for 12 additional high-intent slugs in `pembuatan-website` and `percetakan` clusters with tailored conversion copy (headline/intro/CTA/final CTA/FAQ).
- [x] Live-vs-local rewrite alignment pass completed on priority money pages to capture stronger `Surabaya` geo intent and expand decision-stage SEO support content in rewrite source.
- [x] Live-vs-local rewrite alignment pass v2 completed on city/detail commercial pages to capture stronger local-intent and service-variant query coverage in rewrite source.
- [x] Repo-level SEO operations guidance now points future agents at the vendored Claude SEO toolkit in `skills/claude-seo`, keeping audit workflows versioned with the codebase instead of depending on home-directory skill installs.
- [x] `/pembuatan-website` and key descendants now use cleaner customer-facing copy, with internal notes such as "rewritten from live site", editorial intent phrasing, and overly internal system language removed from public messaging.
- [x] `/pembuatan-website` specialist pages now also expose stronger SEO-supporting section copy (secondary keywords, highlights, process steps, and FAQs) for price, migration, vertical-specific, and template routes.
- [x] `software` and `percetakan` rewrite pages now also avoid internal/editorial phrasing and have cleaner public-facing descriptions, helping the broader rewrite cluster align better with real visitor intent.
- [x] Local homepage/public content sources now also avoid internal editorial notes such as upstream rewrite references and internal QA wording, so the remaining scan hits are concentrated in intentional internal tools and debug surfaces.
- Blocker note (2026-04-02): Live SEO sample audit (`120` URLs) still reports unresolved issues outside migrated frontend scope (`meta_description_too_long: 106`, `title_too_long: 22`, `http_status_not_200: 10`) dominated by legacy live pages/redirect gaps; requires content import/redirect wave plus metadata cleanup on production routes.

### C2. Structured Data
- [ ] Align JSON-LD by template (Article, BreadcrumbList, ItemList, Organization, WebSite).
- [ ] Ensure fallback global SEO data always available.
- [ ] Validate no schema duplication/conflict.

### C3. Technical SEO Fixes
- [x] Resolve non-200 target pages prioritized by traffic.
- [x] Remove orphan/no-value thin pages from index strategy.
- [ ] Rebuild sitemap coverage by canonical route set.
- [x] Core Web Vitals pass: enable Sanity CDN in production, cache homepage query slices, add AVIF/WebP output, and set 10-minute route revalidation for main pages.
- [x] Template performance pass: dynamic-import block renderers plus cached detail fetches (page/post/product/service/project) to reduce JS and TTFB.
- [x] Detail-page hero images optimized (quality 85, width hints, priority on project hero) and hero icon imports tree-shaken to reduce LCP/JS cost.
- [x] Batch CWV tuning (2026-04-06): reduced Sanity image default quality, capped grid/card image widths, added LQIP blur to detail hero images, and limited preload priority in archive grids.
- [x] SEO Ops analytics enrichment shipped (2026-04-11): GSC pull upgraded to multi-dimension aggregation (`page/query/country/device`) and stored `topQueries/topCountries/topDevices` in `analytics_daily`.
- [x] SEO Ops conversion analytics persistence shipped (2026-04-11): GA4 imports now persist to `analytics_ga4_daily` and are surfaced in dashboard analytics joins.
- [x] SEO Ops opportunity workflow shipped (2026-04-11): dedicated board for quick wins, decay pages, and indexing blockers.

## Workstream D - UI Redesign + Refactor

### D1. Design System Alignment
- [x] Define reusable primitives: typography, spacing, button variants, card patterns, nav behavior.
- [x] Harmonize with current header/nav architecture and CMS-driven menus.
  - 2026-04-02 execution: added Astro navigation importer, sanitized legacy header routes (`/posts` -> `/blog`, `/categories/percetakan` -> `/percetakan`, generic archive placeholders to canonical archive roots), and synced grouped submenu structure into the active Sanity `navigation` document.
  - 2026-04-02 execution update: enriched submenu with live dataset-backed `project`/`product` links plus GSC-priority pages (`jasa-cetak-buku-surabaya`, `jasa-instal-aplikasi-surabaya`, `jasa-install-software-macbook`, `jasa-recovery-data-surabaya`, `service-komputer-surabaya-panggilan`, and high-traffic PC guide posts) so the header reflects current demand instead of Astro placeholder-only links.
  - 2026-04-02 execution update: added footer-only support for top-level navigation through Studio flags, and moved lower-priority top-level links (`About`, `Contact`) out of the header while preserving them in the footer.
  - 2026-04-02 execution update: removed submenu description text from header UI and changed mobile nav to keep all accordion groups closed when the sheet opens.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: replaced the generic top-level `Services`/`Portfolio`/`Produk` IA with a more explicit split around business intent (`Home`, `Web Dev`, `IT Service`, `Percetakan`, `Portfolio`, `Produk`, `About`, `Contact`), while keeping `Blog` available as footer-only navigation.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: rewrote the shared rewrite hero into a centered Vercel-inspired layout with exactly two primary actions and routed the lead CTA through Sanity-configured WhatsApp behavior so conversion handling stays aligned with the sticky WhatsApp surface.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: introduced reusable section-shell primitives for visual-driven rewrite pages and migrated quick navigation, service sections, proof sections, highlights, FAQ/process, and related-link surfaces to connected thin-frame/tinted-panel patterns with clearer separators.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: extended the new visual-first rewrite system into the remaining high-intent blocks so pricing, features, testimonials, final CTA, and the hero description area now share the same panel/separator language.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: closed several remaining component gaps versus the Vercel reference set by adding reusable metrics/proof rail, phrase-strip heading, product-stage scene, quote spotlight, and logo-wall modules to the rewrite shell.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: added a dedicated header/mobile WhatsApp CTA sourced from `settings.whatsApp`, sharing the same client-side link builder used by the floating WhatsApp widget and leaving `navigation.headerCta` as a separate navigation-managed action.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: rolled the same global WhatsApp CTA contract into post/product/service/project detail surfaces plus rewrite, legacy, and JSON-usaha CTA buttons, and added a dedicated `whatsapp-cta` page-builder block so editors can place a WhatsApp-first CTA without hardcoding phone links.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: improved `settings.themeColors` editing in Studio with a swatch-based color picker, keeping the same HEX-backed contract while making the brand color UI easier for non-technical editors.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: expanded the `Theme Colors` Studio UI again with an embedded explanation of each color token, preview cards for existing presets, and a short list of recommended brand combinations.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: split theme configuration into its own singleton `Theme Settings` document and updated the frontend theme-settings query to read from that dedicated source instead of the broader `Settings` singleton.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: replaced the universal trust badge image strip with icon-led glass cards and concise supporting copy so the section matches the newer shadcn/Vercel treatment used across the rewrite shell.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: tightened the trust badge cards again so icon and label share one compact row, with only 3-4 words of supporting copy per badge.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: removed the last code-owned root homepage fallback so `/` now hard-depends on the Sanity `index` page document and the orphaned `ui/home` component has been deleted.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: restored the missing `project.categories` field in both Studio schema and frontend project queries so legacy project documents no longer surface category references as unknown fields in Studio.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: split `RewriteLandingSections` into a folder-based module set (`utility-strip`, `service-types`, `pricing-plans`, `features`, `proof`, `testimonials`, `long-guide`, `final-cta`, shared defaults/types) while preserving the existing public import path.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: constrained `SanityLive` to Draft Mode only in the main layout so public landing pages stop hitting client-side live-preview parsing failures during dev/runtime.
  - 2026-04-03 execution update: created a dedicated noindex `/component-ui` route to review the current rewrite primitive set in one place without polluting production indexable navigation.
- [x] Apply shared icon-only social pattern for footer/navigation shell using reusable component contract.
- [x] Apply compact sticky header rhythm with single CTA focus and icon actions (dark mode + social) across desktop/mobile shell.
- [x] Apply Vercel-like visual shell tokens and reusable surface/separator utilities across shared layout blocks (`globals.css`, header, footer, section container, legacy landing shell).
- [x] Integrate official Kotacom brand logo asset as default UI logo fallback and expose brand preview/reference in `/style-guide`.
- [x] Public commercial rewrite pages no longer expose internal component-demo messaging; shell output is trimmed to business-facing hero and content sections only.

### D2. Template Refactor Priority
- [ ] Homepage
- [x] Product-led homepage promoted to `/` using shared UI primitives; `/home` and `/product-home` now act as redirect aliases instead of separate preview destinations
- [x] Root homepage route restored to CMS-first behavior by resolving Sanity `page:index` before the local product-led fallback view, keeping `/home` and `/product-home` as aliases only
- [ ] Blog detail/list/category
- [ ] Service detail/list
- [x] Product detail/list
- [ ] Project detail/list
- [x] Legacy Astro static service/trust clusters switched to reusable rewrite template shell (Wave 1)
- [x] Template-backed money pages now use variant-driven section ordering with lane-specific proof/pricing/testimonial filtering and deterministic support-copy selection from Sanity content variants.
- [x] Root slug static generation expanded for `jasa-cetak-buku-<kota>` pages using deduplicated local dataset adapter
- [x] `layanan/[slug]` legacy Astro JSON pages now served from code-driven local adapter route with normalized section renderer (`agency-landing`, `biro-jasa-perizinan`, `jasa-pengukuhan-pkp`)
- Blocker note (2026-04-02): Remaining template refactors depend on final shared UI shell lock from orchestration (`docs/archive/2026-04-historical-plans/rewrite-worker-orchestration.md`) before broader homepage/blog/product rollout.

### D3. Content UX Upgrade
- [x] Improve readability modules (TOC, CTA in-content, related links, FAQ blocks).
  - Done for legacy rewrite clusters via reusable template sections (CTA, related links, FAQ, process/highlights). TOC remains pending for blog/product/service long-form templates.
- [x] Improve content differentiation across legacy clusters with slug-specific rewrite mapping (Wave 1 service-focused routes).
- [x] Complete rewrite coverage for previously generic route templates in legacy Wave 1 service/printing clusters.
- [x] Add richer conversion-oriented landing sections with iconography and visual proof blocks for legacy rewrite pages.
- [x] Add reusable long-guide section for rewrite pages to preserve and develop long-form legacy knowledge blocks (enabled for `cetak-buku`).
- [x] Add reusable micro-badge visual strip (`fast response`, `secure process`, `guarantee`, `nationwide delivery`, `custom request`) sourced from split pack and embedded in rewrite/legacy page shells.
- [x] Final CTA button label now reuses per-page copy (`copy.ctaLabel`) in both rewrite and legacy landing sections to keep UI/message parity across migrated money pages.
- [x] Rewrite/legacy landing sections now include additional mid-page conversion CTA block (`#cta-mid`) and expanded final CTA action set to increase action opportunities on commercial pages.
- [x] JSON-usaha service templates now include stronger conversion CTA placement (hero, service cards, mid CTA, pricing cards, FAQ closeout, final CTA fallback) plus intent-based copy normalization from local source parser.
- [x] Rewrite shared sections now include extra CTA placements in `highlights` and `process-faq` to reinforce conversion paths on money pages using reusable UI blocks.
- [x] Legacy rewrite content source is now registry-driven and split by cluster, reducing single-file coupling while preserving existing route/render contracts.
- [x] Legacy rewrite override maps are now separated per cluster so high-intent page tuning can be maintained without cross-domain merge noise.
- [x] `percetakan` cluster has started moving from cluster-branch content to page-specific modules for top anchor routes, establishing the per-page pattern for the next migration wave.
- [x] `percetakan` cluster now uses a split submodule layout for anchor pages, remaining detail presets, and city-intent overrides, reducing cluster-level file size and coupling.
- [x] `software` cluster now follows the same per-page module pattern for anchor routes and `sistem-pos`, with registry-level page resolution and a thinner cluster fallback builder.
- [x] `pembuatan-website` cluster has started following the same per-page module pattern for key money pages, with registry-level route resolution for anchor/index pages and a new `website-pages/*` content layer.
- [x] `pembuatan-website` non-city service routes are now almost fully page-module driven, so the cluster fallback is largely reserved for city templates and unforeseen slugs.
- [x] `pembuatan-website` parity refinement has begun at the content level, with page modules gradually absorbing Astro-specific business intent instead of only generic rewrite scaffolding.
- [x] Hybrid code-plus-Sanity pattern has a live demo route and a seeded Sanity page document, reducing ambiguity before deciding whether main cluster pages should stay code-owned, CMS-owned, or hybrid.
- [x] Homepage and primary landing shells now share one hybrid rendering contract (`/`, `/layanan`, `/pembuatan-website`, `/percetakan`, `/software`), reducing route-level divergence while keeping code-owned funnel sections where needed.
- [x] Main-route hybrid setup is now operationalized through a CLI scaffold with `main-landing` and `homepage` presets, making it faster to convert eligible routes without hand-crafting every Sanity page seed.
- [x] Homepage migration can now be rehearsed on a dedicated `/home-pepar` hybrid route seeded from the `homepage` preset, reducing pressure on the live `/` path during theme/content convergence.
- [x] Archive guidance is now explicit at `frontend/components/archive/README.md`, so the rewrite/hybrid stack remains the visible active source while historical component sets stay documented but quarantined.
- [x] Hybrid preset helpers now default internal links to `isExternal: false`, keeping generated Sanity data aligned with Studio link expectations during broader homepage and landing-page rollout.
- [x] GitHub Actions workflows now opt JavaScript actions into Node 24, reducing CI/deploy noise while the hybrid homepage and Studio schema rollout continues on `main`.
- [x] Core GitHub Actions references have also been moved forward (`actions/checkout@v6`, `actions/setup-node@v6`, `dorny/paths-filter@v4`) so the remaining CI warnings should be limited to vendor actions that have not yet published newer runtimes.
- [x] Existing Sanity `page` documents can now be audited and normalized for `_key` and `isExternal` consistency, and the current dataset has been brought back to zero findings after running the normalizer.
- [x] Custom Studio page document actions no longer rely on `useClient()`, reducing coupling to editor-only React contexts and preventing Task UI crashes while hybrid/page-to-post tools remain enabled.
- [x] `page`-specific Studio actions are temporarily rolled back from the active action registry so Task creation and core editing flows stay stable while the custom action API mismatch is debugged separately.
- [x] Studio core packages are now upgraded to `5.19.0`, so the hosted Studio can pick up newer Task/document runtime fixes after the custom-action rollback proved insufficient on its own.
- [x] `page`-specific Studio actions are now re-enabled on top of the upgraded `5.19.0` runtime, restoring the hybrid preset and page-to-post conversion workflow in Studio.
- [x] Historical migration planning docs and worker prompt files are now moved under `docs/archive/`, leaving `docs/` focused on current operational guidance and active workflows.
- [x] Rewrite landing sections now have stronger service/pricing interaction polish, and pricing cards can route package-specific WhatsApp leads through the shared global WhatsApp settings path.
- [x] Rewrite template UX now enforces a single CTA hierarchy and lane-aware closeout flow: quick links are capped to two, final CTA secondary actions are lane-specific, and raw location tokens are stripped from non-location routes before render.
- [x] Template-backed location/service route indexing state is now operationally normalized via a dedicated Sanity script, and the current active set has been patched from legacy `draft/noindex` flags to public `index` state.
- [x] The lane-aware template resolver now has an executable contract test entrypoint in `frontend`, reducing reliance on manual QA for pricing/proof/token guardrails after future schema or copy changes.
- [x] `/home-pepar` has been rewritten away from prototype/internal explanatory language and now reads as a customer-facing homepage candidate that is materially closer to live use.
- [x] Printing rewrite modules are back to a deployable state after restoring the missing `buildGenericCopy` import for the company profile page module.
- [x] Netlify edge bundling compatibility hardening applied for Next proxy by explicitly setting proxy runtime to `edge`, avoiding `___netlify-edge-handler-node-middleware` CJS/ESM crash during build.
- [ ] Ensure internal linking slots are CMS-configurable.
- Blocker note (2026-04-02): Priority-1 illustration assets are generated but integration into live page sections/routes is still pending.
- Blocker note (2026-04-02): Regenerated `v2` assets are ready, but final selection/approval and route-level wiring are still pending.

## Workstream E - Redirect Deployment Strategy

### E1. Wave Rollout
- [ ] Wave 1: top traffic redirects only (safe subset).
- [ ] Wave 2: remaining validated auto redirects.
- [ ] Wave 3: curated manual redirects.
- Note: redirect rollout explicitly deferred until rewrite coverage for legacy Astro clusters is completed.

### E2. Post-wave Monitoring
- [ ] Check 404/redirect-chain loops.
- [ ] Check GSC coverage/index trend after each wave.
- [ ] Rollback rules prepared for bad mappings.

## Content Movement Mega Plan

### Source Buckets
- [x] Astro `posts/*.mdx` -> Sanity `post`
- [x] Astro `services/*.mdx` -> Sanity `service`
- [x] Astro `projects/*.mdx` -> Sanity `project`
- [ ] Legacy landing trees (`pembuatan-website`, `percetakan`, `software`, `layanan`) ->
  - keep-as-page OR merge-into-canonical OR redirect-only
- [x] Repo-local root-slug Astro pack `jasa-cetak-buku-kota` -> Sanity `page`

### Movement Checklist Per Item
- [ ] Normalize slug
- [ ] Set canonical target route
- [ ] Map category/taxonomy
- [ ] Rewrite title + meta + OG
- [ ] Add schema blocks needed
- [ ] Add internal links to canonical cluster
- [ ] Mark redirect old URL

## Execution Cadence

### Sprint 1 (Foundation)
- [ ] Freeze schema/query/route contracts
- [x] Start top-300 manual curation
- [x] Fix highest-impact non-200 pages

### Sprint 2 (Template + Metadata)
- [ ] Complete core template parity
- [x] Add Sanity template documents + template resolver for rewrite shells (hybrid-ready)
- [ ] Rewrite high-impression metadata batch
- [x] Deploy redirect wave 1

### Sprint 3 (Scale + Cleanup)
- [ ] Expand content movement long-tail
- [x] Deploy redirect wave 2-3
- [ ] Stabilize index coverage and remove residual gaps

## Risks & Controls

- Risk: redirect ke halaman intent tidak cocok -> Control: mandatory intent QA for high-impression URLs.
- Risk: schema/query mismatch after refactor -> Control: studio/frontend sync check in each PR.
- Risk: quota limits for URL inspection -> Control: schedule inspection in batches and cache results.
